# 🎯 **Damped Pendulum Simulation**
## 🔍 **Overview**
This repository simulates a **damped pendulum**, modelling its motion under gravity and damping forces. The simulation numerically solves the governing differential equations and visualises the pendulum's behaviour over time.

## 🎨 **Features**
- 🔢 **Numerical Solver:** Implements numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the damped pendulum.
- 📊 **Visualisation:** This animation of the pendulum's motion plots key parameters such as displacement and linear velocity over time.
- ⚙️ **Parameter Customisation:** Users can adjust physical parameters like pendulum length, damping coefficient, and initial conditions.

## 📚 **Derivation: Stopping Time of a Damped Pendulum**

A **damped pendulum** experiences resistive forces (e.g., air resistance or friction at the pivot), causing its oscillations to decay over time. The **equation of motion** for a simple damped pendulum is:
```math
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = 0
```

where:
- **$`\theta`$** is the angular displacement,
- **$`g`$** is the acceleration due to gravity,
- **$`L`$** is the length of the pendulum,
- **$`\beta = \frac{b}{2m}`$** is the damping coefficient, with $`b`$ being the damping force per unit velocity and $`m`$ the pendulum's mass.

### **Approximation for Small Angles and Overdamped Regime**

For small angles **$`\sin\theta \approx \theta`$**, the equation simplifies to:

```math
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = 0
```
where **$`\omega_0 = \sqrt{g/L}`$** is the natural frequency.

The general solution for a weakly damped **$`(\beta < \omega_0)`$** system is:

```math
\theta(t) = \theta_0 e^{-\beta t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi)
```

where **$`\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}`$** is the damped frequency.

The pendulum has "stopped" when its amplitude falls below a small threshold **$`\theta_{min}`$**, typically close to zero.

### **Stopping Time Estimation**

Setting **$`\theta(t_{stop}) = \theta_{min}`$**, we solve:

```math
\theta_{min} = \theta_0 e^{-\beta t_{stop}}
```
Taking the natural logarithm:

```math
t_{stop} = \frac{1}{\beta} \ln\left(\frac{\theta_0}{\theta_{min}}\right)
```

This formula estimates the time required for the pendulum to rest under damping effectively.

## 🎯 **Improvements**
Future enhancements could include:
- Implementing **additional numerical solvers** for comparison.
- Adding a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for interactive parameter adjustments.
- Extending the simulation to model **driven pendulums** or **coupled pendulum systems**.
